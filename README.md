# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier

This project trains a neural network to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

## What I learned
- Loading and preparing image data
- Building neural networks with Keras Sequential API
- Training models with epochs
- Evaluating and making predictions
- Preparing for convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

## How to run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the `mnist_model.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter  
3. Run the cells step-by-step to train and test the model

## Next steps
- Improve model accuracy with CNNs    
- Explore model activation maps
